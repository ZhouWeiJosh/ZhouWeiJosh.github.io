## Development Environment

Through this course, I learned that having a consistent and well configured development environment is not just a convenience but a productivity booster. While this class focused on web applications, the importance of development environment goes further into my extracurriculars. In my Vertically Integrated Project (VIP), RoSE, where we develop a rover for the University Rover Challenge, I have seen firsthand how inconsistent environments can slow down progress. When teammates struggle with setup issues or tool mismatches, valuable time is lost before meaningful work even begins. By contrast, understanding how to configure and use tools like VS Code effectively along with integrated GitHub workflows has allowed me to work more efficiently and collaborate more seamlessly. This experience reinforced that investing time upfront in a proper development environment leads to long-term gains in speed, consistency, and confidence across any software project.

## Coding Standards
Before this course, I underestimated how impactful coding standards could be outside of academic settings. In practice, especially in large collaborative projects like RoSE, a lack of uniform coding standards makes code harder to read, debug, and maintain. This class emphasized that coding standards are about improving clarity and collaboration. When everyone follows the same conventions, it becomes easier to understand others’ code, identify bugs, and review changes efficiently. These lessons apply well beyond web development, as any long-term or team-based software effort benefits from readable and predictable code. Learning this has shifted how I approach programming: I now see clean, standardized code as a foundational requirement for scalable and maintainable systems.
