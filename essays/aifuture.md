## Introduction

The rapid emergence of AI chatbots is a relatively recent development, yet it has already significantly altered the educational environment, particularly within computer-related fields such as software engineering. In courses like ICS 314, AI tools have become both a resource and a point of concern, raising questions about their role in learning and skill development. On one hand, AI provides quick access to information and explanations without social pressure or judgment, making it easier for students to ask questions they might otherwise avoid. On the other hand, excessive reliance on AI can hinder independent thinking and problem-solving abilities. For this course, I primarily used ChatGPT and occasionally Google Gemini when searching for explanations or background information.

## Personal Experience with AI

### WODs and Practice WODs

For Experience WODs, in-class practice WODs, and in-class WODs, I used AI sparingly at the beginning of the semester and more frequently as the workload increased. I primarily used AI to help structure and build my surfing-related website, especially when I was unsure how to implement certain features. While AI was helpful for getting started, the solutions often required adjustment to meet the specific WOD requirements.

### Essays and Concept Learning

For essays, I occasionally used AI to review or check my writing rather than generate content. I preferred writing essays myself and relied on my own judgment for structure and grammar. I also used AI to help understand difficult concepts or tutorials when the course material was unclear or when time was limited.

### Coding and Final Project

I used AI extensively during the final project to help with coding, debugging, and working through implementation details. AI was also used to generate code examples, explain existing code, and assist with writing code for assignments and WODs. In some cases, I used it to help document code or clarify what certain sections were doing.

### Quality Assurance and Other Uses

For quality assurance, I used AI to help identify and fix ESLint and linting errors in my WOD submissions. I did not use AI to ask or answer questions in class or on Discord, nor did I use it to generate or respond to smart questions. Aside from these uses, I did not rely on AI for additional tasks outside of the requirements of ICS 314.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding

The impact of AI on my learning experience has been complicated. Having access to tools like ChatGPT made learning more accessible and reduced the barrier to understanding difficult concepts, but it also introduced the risk of overreliance. While I did learn throughout the course, I believe that relying on AI at times reduced the depth of that learning. There were moments where the primary goal became completing an assignment rather than fully understanding the material. The limited time available for the course often pushed me toward efficiency over mastery, making it difficult to fully evaluate how much AI helped versus how much it replaced independent problem-solving.

## Practical Applications

Outside of ICS 314, I am involved in a robotics club focused on rover development, where I frequently use ChatGPT to help understand frameworks, tools, and technical concepts. While AI is useful for high-level explanations and initial guidance, I have found that relying too much on it can limit deeper understanding. Over time, I have learned that forums, documentation, and tutorials often provide clearer and more reliable explanations than AI-generated responses. As a result, I now try to use AI more as a supplementary learning tool rather than a primary source of solutions, especially when working on complex or long-term projects.

## Challenges and Opportunities

One of the main challenges of using AI is its lack of precision and control, especially in larger projects. AI-generated solutions can sometimes obscure important details or lead to confusion when trying to integrate multiple components. This makes it easy to lose sight of how different parts of a system work together. However, AI also presents opportunities when used correctly, such as accelerating learning, reducing frustration, and providing alternative perspectives. The key challenge lies in finding a balance between using AI as a tool and maintaining a strong understanding of the underlying concepts.


## Comparative Analysis

Traditional teaching methods still play a crucial role in software engineering education, particularly when it comes to building foundational knowledge. While AI enhanced approaches can improve efficiency and accessibility, much of meaningful learning comes from hands-on practice, repetition, and visual feedback. AI can sometimes undermine this process by offering shortcuts that bypass learning. Without discipline and motivation, students may rely too heavily on AI, reducing engagement and long-term knowledge retention compared to traditional methods.

## Future Considerations

Looking ahead, AI should remain a part of software engineering education, as it reflects tools commonly used in real world environments. However, its use should be moderated and guided to ensure that students still develop independent problem-solving skills. Establishing clear boundaries on acceptable AI usage can help maintain academic integrity while still allowing students to benefit from its advantages. Being able to work without AI and fully understand one’s own code will remain an essential skill.

## Conclusion

Overall, AI has become an essential tool within computer related majors, including software engineering. While it offers significant benefits in accessibility and efficiency, it also introduces challenges related to overreliance and shallow learning. As AI continues to evolve, the importance of genuine skill development and the ability to articulate and defend one’s work becomes even more critical. Striking a balance between learning and convenience will be key for students, especially as future generations enter a workforce where AI assisted tools are increasingly common.
