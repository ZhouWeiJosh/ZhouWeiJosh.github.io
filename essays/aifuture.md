## Introduction

The rapid emergence of AI chatbots is a relatively recent development, yet it has already significantly altered the educational environment, particularly within computer-related fields such as software engineering. In courses like ICS 314, AI tools have become both a resource and a point of concern, raising questions about their role in learning and skill development. On one hand, AI provides quick access to information and explanations without social pressure or judgment, making it easier for students to ask questions they might otherwise avoid. On the other hand, excessive reliance on AI can hinder independent thinking and problem-solving abilities. For this course, I primarily used ChatGPT and occasionally Google Gemini when searching for explanations or background information.

## Personal Experience with AI

My personal experience with AI in ICS 314 has been mixed. Initially, I tried to avoid relying on AI too heavily because I wanted to develop my own understanding of the material. However, as the semester progressed and the workload increased especially with in class WODs and practice WODs it became difficult not to use AI due to time constraints and pressure from other courses. I frequently used AI to help understand WOD instructions or clarify concepts when I felt stuck, though I did not always find the responses immediately useful and often had to interpret or adjust them myself.

For essays, I primarily wrote them on my own and relied on my intuition for structure and grammar rather than using AI to generate content. Toward the end of the semester, especially during finals, I used AI more frequently for homework assignments and parts of the final project. I also used AI to learn concepts, ask questions during Discord discussions, and occasionally review code examples or explanations. While AI was useful for explaining code or suggesting solutions, I avoided directly copying generated code and instead used it as a reference to better understand how something might work.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding

The impact of AI on my learning experience has been complicated. Having access to tools like ChatGPT made learning more accessible and reduced the barrier to understanding difficult concepts, but it also introduced the risk of overreliance. While I did learn throughout the course, I believe that relying on AI at times reduced the depth of that learning. There were moments where the primary goal became completing an assignment rather than fully understanding the material. The limited time available for the course often pushed me toward efficiency over mastery, making it difficult to fully evaluate how much AI helped versus how much it replaced independent problem-solving.

## Practical Applications

Outside of ICS 314, I am involved in a robotics club focused on rover development, where I frequently use ChatGPT to help understand frameworks, tools, and technical concepts. While AI is useful for high-level explanations and initial guidance, I have found that relying too much on it can limit deeper understanding. Over time, I have learned that forums, documentation, and tutorials often provide clearer and more reliable explanations than AI-generated responses. As a result, I now try to use AI more as a supplementary learning tool rather than a primary source of solutions, especially when working on complex or long-term projects.

## Challenges and Opportunities

One of the main challenges of using AI is its lack of precision and control, especially in larger projects. AI-generated solutions can sometimes obscure important details or lead to confusion when trying to integrate multiple components. This makes it easy to lose sight of how different parts of a system work together. However, AI also presents opportunities when used correctly, such as accelerating learning, reducing frustration, and providing alternative perspectives. The key challenge lies in finding a balance between using AI as a tool and maintaining a strong understanding of the underlying concepts.


## Comparative Analysis

Traditional teaching methods still play a crucial role in software engineering education, particularly when it comes to building foundational knowledge. While AI enhanced approaches can improve efficiency and accessibility, much of meaningful learning comes from hands-on practice, repetition, and visual feedback. AI can sometimes undermine this process by offering shortcuts that bypass learning. Without discipline and motivation, students may rely too heavily on AI, reducing engagement and long-term knowledge retention compared to traditional methods.

## Future Considerations

Looking ahead, AI should remain a part of software engineering education, as it reflects tools commonly used in real world environments. However, its use should be moderated and guided to ensure that students still develop independent problem-solving skills. Establishing clear boundaries on acceptable AI usage can help maintain academic integrity while still allowing students to benefit from its advantages. Being able to work without AI and fully understand one’s own code will remain an essential skill.

## Conclusion

Overall, AI has become an essential tool within computer related majors, including software engineering. While it offers significant benefits in accessibility and efficiency, it also introduces challenges related to overreliance and shallow learning. As AI continues to evolve, the importance of genuine skill development and the ability to articulate and defend one’s work becomes even more critical. Striking a balance between learning and convenience will be key for students, especially as future generations enter a workforce where AI assisted tools are increasingly common.
