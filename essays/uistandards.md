## The Walking

With no foundation, especially in sports, jumping straight into the fancy stuff is hard and often not forgiving. And believe it or not, it applies to the realm of UI frameworks. It is important to have a foundation of HTML and CSS, to understand the inner workings of frameworks like Bootstrap 5. I would not teach you to dunk a basketball if you do not even know how to properly implement it in a game. It is the culmination of knowledge that brings to life the line/direction one should take. Though HTML and CSS may seem like they are archaic, both pave the way to more complex and interesting programs.
