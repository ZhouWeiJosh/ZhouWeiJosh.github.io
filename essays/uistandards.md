## The Walking

With no foundation, especially in sports, jumping straight into the fancy stuff is hard and often not forgiving. And believe it or not, it applies to the realm of UI frameworks. It is important to have a foundation of HTML and CSS, to understand the inner workings of frameworks like Bootstrap 5. I would not teach you to dunk a basketball if you do not even know how to properly implement it in a game. It is the culmination of knowledge that brings to life the line/direction one should take. Though HTML and CSS may seem like they are archaic, both pave the way to more complex and interesting programs. 

## Importance of Form

The question of why not comes into play in many conversations. In this case specifically, "Why not do everything in HTML and CSS if they are the foundation of everything." Well to that I say why do you use math libraries and many others when you can write most of it yourself. These frameworks/libraries are there to make our lives easier. UI frameworks are not going to be the end all be all for most projects. You can always just revert back to using HTML and CSS, it just depends on how much control you want over the things that you make. If you want to have more control you would primarily work in HTML and CSS, but if you want to have predesigned and a more structured way of programming Bootstrap 5 would be the way to go. However, you might find it hard to use Bootstrap 5, but that is true for many things. The most important thing is that the tradeoffs are beneficial to the kind of project that you are working. I think that using Bootstrap might be more scalable when you have larger projects and using basic HTML/CSS for smaller projects. 

## The Running

Just like anything in life you have to start somewhere before building out into more complex projects. I think of HTML and CSS as the basis for Bootstrap 5 and to understand how it works and functions. To be proficient in anything you have to work from the ground up and figure out the nuances in both to gain a better picture. I personally have been trying to working on learning about robot autonomy, but I am still working my way through the basics in this moment in time. So before I can apply the research that I have been looking at, I have to be compentent in the knowledge of how it should work. To be able to catch mistakes when they happen and be confident working with it. Same way with web development you have to learn Javascript, HTML, CSS, and more to move onto the more complex and interesting development tools.
